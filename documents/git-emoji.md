# Commit Message Emoji

Every commit is important.
So let's celebrate each and every commit with a corresponding emoji! :smile:

Oh, and it can also help with glancing over commit messages to figure out
what kind of changes have been made. :smirk:

## Usage

Prepend every commit message with an emoji with this form:
`:emoji: commit message`.
